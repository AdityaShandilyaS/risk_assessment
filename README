A simple package to assess risk of attrition in workplaces. Submit a file in the CLI to predict attrition risk with a pre-trained model.

The training is for datasets with columns: Corporation name, lastmonth_activity, lastyear_activity, number of employees and the label column: exited.
Push training sets in the above format into the inputdata folder to add to training samples, train new models and predict with the CLI

This version avails the user to tinker with decision tree models by changing 3 hyperparameters: splitter, max_depth and min_samples_split

CLI TEMPLATES

training a decision tree model:

risk_assessment/main.py train -m <modelname> -s <splitter value> -md <max_depth> -mss <min_samples_split>

e.g.: risk_assessment/main.py train -m mark1 -s 'random' -md 4 -mss 5

predicting using a trained model:

risk_assessment/main.py predict -d <dataset csv name> -m <modelname>

e.g.: risk_assessment/main.py predict -d dataset3.csv -m mark1
